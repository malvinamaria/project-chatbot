# Project Chat Bot

With this eeek project I have designed a simple chat bot. It ask user for some music prefernces and returns some music suggestions based on the user ansers. 

## The problem

I have spend some time looking into other people code and tried to understand their approach. This has given me confidence with starting my own bot. I have used all the materials provided by Technigo. Aswell as a lot of googling, StackOverflow and asking in the slack. If I had more time I would have add more iterations and sound affects to the bot.
